There you are, Sophie — congratulations!

00:00:03.093 --> 00:00:05.543
The executive committee is thrilled with the results.

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:08.305
They now want to accelerate deployment company-wide.

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.270
That's great news, but it's also a big step.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.020
Scaling a few pilots was one thing; scaling dozens
of solutions across countries, functions, and partners

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.991
is another story.

00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:25.020
They've identified new areas — marketing automation,
player support, predictive content creation — and

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.171
want to go all-in.

00:00:26.785 --> 00:00:28.544
Ambitious and exciting!

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:32.804
But we'll need stronger data foundations, new skills,
and clear governance.

00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:36.831
Let's make sure we build for the long run, not just
the next quarter.

00:00:37.132 --> 00:00:38.038
Absolutely!

00:00:38.188 --> 00:00:39.291
You'll need help to get there.

00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:41.043
Maybe it's time to call Carlos?

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:42.017
Good idea.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.167
He always knows how to bring perspective
