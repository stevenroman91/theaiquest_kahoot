Sophie.

00:00:01.493 --> 00:00:02.654
We've made progress.

00:00:02.804 --> 00:00:04.986
Some things clearly moved in the right direction.

00:00:05.236 --> 00:00:10.356
Yes, the teams are more confident with AI, and we've
seen some encouraging outcomes, though not yet at

00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:11.006
full scale.

00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:12.046
That's fair.

00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:13.357
You've built momentum.

00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:15.132
Now, we just need to make it stick.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:15.893
Agreed.

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:18.319
We know what works — we'll push it further.

00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:19.126
Good.

00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:20.669
Keep the focus, Sophie.

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:23.513
We're on the right path — but we're not there yet.
