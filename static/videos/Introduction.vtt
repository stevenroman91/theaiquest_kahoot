00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.043
Thanks for joining, Sophie.

00:00:02.093 --> 00:00:04.182
I'll be honest — we're at a crossroads.

00:00:04.232 --> 00:00:09.108
Our latest releases performed well, but production
timelines are stretching, and player engagement is

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:09.898
plateauing.

00:00:10.048 --> 00:00:12.370
We need something to reignite our momentum.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.542
Something bold.

00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:15.875
Everyone's talking about AI — what's your take?

00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:17.369
You're right, Marcus.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.444
AI can be a real catalyst if we approach it strategically.

00:00:21.594 --> 00:00:28.074
It's not just automation — it's about accelerating
creativity, personalizing player experiences, and

00:00:28.074 --> 00:00:30.173
making smarter business decisions.

00:00:30.473 --> 00:00:31.263
I like that.

00:00:31.413 --> 00:00:34.292
But we're not a tech company — we're a gaming company.

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:38.436
How do we use Artificial Intelligence without losing
what makes us - us?

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:43.357
That's the challenge — to integrate AI with our culture,
not against it.

00:00:43.507 --> 00:00:48.778
Used right, AI can free our teams from repetitive
work and give them more time to create.

00:00:48.928 --> 00:00:52.225
But we'll need the right governance, tools, and alignment.

00:00:52.525 --> 00:00:53.268
Agreed.

00:00:53.418 --> 00:01:00.105
Here's what I need from you: define how AI can help
us boost innovation, reduce time-to-market by 25%,

00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:04.053
and enhance player satisfaction by 40% within 18 months.

00:01:04.203 --> 00:01:09.032
You'll have to bring together the right people and
balance ambition with pragmatism.

00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:10.297
Can you lead this?

00:01:10.597 --> 00:01:11.456
Absolutely!

00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:15.890
I'll start by gathering insights from our key leaders
and come back with a concrete roadmap.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.026
Perfect.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:21.681
Let's make this transformation real — and make PlayForward
a true AI pioneer.
