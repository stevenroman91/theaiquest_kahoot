00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.569
Hello everyone and welcome.

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:08.399
I am Steven, and I am thrilled to have you here for
The AI Transformation Simulation for Leaders, created

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:12.274
exclusively by FDJ UNITED and for FDJ UNITED.

00:00:12.374 --> 00:00:16.867
This is not just another training, this is a serious
game designed for decision-makers like you.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:22.857
In this experience, you'll face real-world challenges,
make strategic choices, and see their impact unfold —

00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:24.180
all in real time.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.135
I'll be guiding you throughout the game and give
you regular feedback as you progress.

00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:31.717
What if generative AI became a real lever for your
teams?

00:00:31.977 --> 00:00:32.641
Not a trend.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:33.577
Not jargon.

00:00:33.677 --> 00:00:39.437
But a real lever to boost creativity, speed, and
engagement across the customer experience and the

00:00:39.437 --> 00:00:40.527
employee journey!

00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.821
Your journey follows five clear, practical steps.

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:47.392
In the first step, you'll define your AI vision and
strategy.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.092
Next,

00:00:48.192 --> 00:00:49.898
You will choose the right use cases,

00:00:49.998 --> 00:00:55.699
the ones that deliver real value, quickly, with manageable
risk and reasonable effort.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.705
In the step three,

00:00:56.805 --> 00:01:00.810
You'll launch your first pilots and demonstrate their
potential to build momentum.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.175
You will then industrialize what works!

00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:08.108
Activating the right governance, people and technology
enablers at the right time.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.780
Finally,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.240
you'll open the aperture and define the path forward
to scale AI

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.660
Throughout the simulation, you'll play the role of
Sophie, the AI Director of an online betting and lottery

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.166
company called PlayForward.

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:24.196
You will interact with key stakeholders, navigate
realistic scenarios, and have to strike the right

00:01:24.196 --> 00:01:27.072
balance across value, risk, and ethics.

00:01:27.422 --> 00:01:28.559
Now it's your turn.

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:29.940
Every choice matters.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.601
Shape.

00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:31.297
Choose.

00:01:31.527 --> 00:01:32.050
Secure.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.967
Scale.

00:01:33.117 --> 00:01:34.719
Across the 5 steps of the game.

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.304
And unlock the full potential of your teams—in our
sector, in our reality!

00:01:39.404 --> 00:01:40.077
Good luck!
