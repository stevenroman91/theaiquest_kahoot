Thanks for joining, Sophie.

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:03.950
I'll be honest — we're at a crossroads.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.248
Our latest releases performed well, but production
timelines are stretching, and player engagement is

00:00:09.248 --> 00:00:10.037
plateauing.

00:00:10.187 --> 00:00:12.417
We need something to reignite our momentum.

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:13.542
Something bold.

00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:16.432
Everyone's talking about AI — what's your take?

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:17.880
You're right, Marcus.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.618
AI can be a real catalyst if we approach it strategically.

00:00:21.768 --> 00:00:27.528
It's not just automation — it's about accelerating
creativity, personalizing player experiences, and

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:29.372
making smarter business decisions.

00:00:29.672 --> 00:00:30.508
I like that.

00:00:30.658 --> 00:00:33.630
But we're not a tech company — we're a gaming company.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.356
How do we use Artificial Intelligence without losing
what makes us - us?

00:00:37.656 --> 00:00:41.557
That's the challenge — to integrate AI with our culture,
not against it.

00:00:42.027 --> 00:00:46.990
Used right, AI can free our teams from repetitive
work and give them more time to create.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.868
But we'll need the right governance, tools, and alignment.

00:00:50.168 --> 00:00:50.865
Agreed.

00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:57.958
Here's what I need from you: define how AI can help
us boost innovation, reduce time-to-market by 25%,

00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:01.974
and enhance player satisfaction by 40% within 18 months.

00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:06.490
You'll have to bring together the right people and
balance ambition with pragmatism.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.615
Can you lead this?

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:08.925
Absolutely!

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:13.545
I'll start by gathering insights from our key leaders
and come back with a concrete roadmap.

00:01:13.845 --> 00:01:14.588
Perfect.

00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:19.614
Let's make this transformation real — and make PlayForward
a true AI pioneer.
