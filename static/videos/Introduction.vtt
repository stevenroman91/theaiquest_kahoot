00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.043
Thanks for joining, Sophie.

00:00:02.093 --> 00:00:04.090
I'll be honest — we're at a crossroads.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.364
Our latest releases performed well, but production
timelines are stretching, and player engagement is

00:00:09.364 --> 00:00:10.130
plateauing.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.417
We need something to reignite our momentum.

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:13.588
Something bold.

00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:16.478
Everyone's talking about AI — what's your take?

00:00:16.928 --> 00:00:17.811
You're right, Marcus.

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:21.873
AI can be a real catalyst if we approach it strategically.

00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:28.023
It's not just automation — it's about accelerating
creativity, personalizing player experiences, and

00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:29.953
making smarter business decisions.

00:00:30.253 --> 00:00:31.042
I like that.

00:00:31.192 --> 00:00:34.211
But we're not a tech company — we're a gaming company.

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:38.169
How do we use Artificial Intelligence without losing
what makes us - us?

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.312
That's the challenge — to integrate AI with our culture,
not against it.

00:00:42.462 --> 00:00:47.257
Used right, AI can free our teams from repetitive
work and give them more time to create.

00:00:47.407 --> 00:00:50.228
But we'll need the right governance, tools, and alignment.

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:51.225
Agreed.

00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:58.596
Here's what I need from you: define how AI can help
us boost innovation, reduce time-to-market by 25%,

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:02.474
and enhance player satisfaction by 40% within 18 months.

00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:07.128
You'll have to bring together the right people and
balance ambition with pragmatism.

00:01:07.278 --> 00:01:08.346
Can you lead this?

00:01:08.646 --> 00:01:09.575
Absolutely!

00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:13.870
I'll start by gathering insights from our key leaders
and come back with a concrete roadmap.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.774
Perfect.

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:19.568
Let's make this transformation real — and make PlayNext
a true AI pioneer.
