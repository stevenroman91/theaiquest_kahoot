00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.136
Thanks for joining, Sophie.

00:00:02.186 --> 00:00:04.090
I'll be honest — we're at a crossroads.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.247
Our latest releases performed well, but production
timelines are stretching, and player engagement is

00:00:10.247 --> 00:00:11.013
plateauing.

00:00:11.163 --> 00:00:13.531
We need something to reignite our momentum.

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:14.749
Something bold.

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:17.686
Everyone's talking about AI — what's your take?

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:19.192
You're right, Marcus.

00:00:19.342 --> 00:00:22.616
AI can be a real catalyst if we approach it strategically.

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:29.246
It's not just automation — it's about accelerating
creativity, personalizing player experiences, and

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:31.125
making smarter business decisions.

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:32.168
I like that.

00:00:32.318 --> 00:00:34.826
But we're not a tech company — we're a gaming company.

00:00:34.976 --> 00:00:38.970
How do we use Artificial Intelligence without losing
what makes us - us?

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.751
That's the challenge — to integrate AI with our culture,
not against it.

00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:48.476
Used right, AI can free our teams from repetitive
work and give them more time to create.

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:52.132
But we'll need the right governance, tools, and alignment.

00:00:52.432 --> 00:00:53.036
Agreed.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:01:00.001
Here's what I need from you: define how AI can help
us boost innovation, reduce time-to-market by 25%,

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.774
and enhance player satisfaction by 40% within 18 months.

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:08.522
You'll have to bring together the right people and
balance ambition with pragmatism.

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:09.740
Can you lead this?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.887
Absolutely!

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:15.391
I'll start by gathering insights from our key leaders
and come back with a concrete roadmap.

00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:16.527
Perfect.

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:20.996
Let's make this transformation real — and make PlayForward
a true AI pioneer.
