Thanks for joining, Sophie. I'll be honest — we're at a crossroads. Our latest releases performed well, but production timelines are stretching, and player engagement is plateauing. We need something to reignite our momentum. Something bold. Everyone's talking about AI — what's your take?You're right, Marcus. AI can be a real catalyst if we approach it strategically. It's not just automation — it's about accelerating creativity, personalizing player experiences, and making smarter business decisions. I like that. But we're not a tech company — we're a gaming company. How do we use Artificial Intelligence without losing what makes us - us? That's the challenge — to integrate AI with our culture, not against it. Used right, AI can free our teams from repetitive work and give them more time to create. But we'll need the right governance, tools, and alignment. Agreed. Here's what I need from you: define how AI can help us boost innovation, reduce time-to-market by 25%, and enhance player satisfaction by 40% within 18 months. You'll have to bring together the right people and balance ambition with pragmatism. Can you lead this? Absolutely! I'll start by gathering insights from our key leaders and come back with a concrete roadmap. Perfect. Let's make this transformation real — and make PlayNext a true AI pioneer.
