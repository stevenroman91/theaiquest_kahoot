Thanks, Carlos. But now the scale is changing. We're moving from a few projects to dozens. I want to make sure we don't outgrow our capacity.

You're right. Scaling multiple AI solutions means managing three things at once: data volume, ecosystem integration, and people capabilities. You'll need to expand your data management capacity, reinforce integration with existing systems, and invest in skills and partnerships to sustain growth.

00:00:37.382 --> 00:00:41.217
So it's less about multiplying models, and more about multiplying readiness.

Exactly. Build a stronger AI hub, formalise a preferred supplier network, and keep developing your AI academy. Remember — success at scale comes from people who understand both AI and the business.
