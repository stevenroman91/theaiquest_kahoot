Sophie, Good to hear from you.

00:00:02.373 --> 00:00:04.184
I've been hearing great things about your work.

00:00:04.414 --> 00:00:07.806
Sounds like PlayForward is becoming quite the AI
powerhouse.

00:00:07.956 --> 00:00:09.279
Impressive work so far.

00:00:09.565 --> 00:00:10.401
Thanks, Carlos.

00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:12.537
Things have moved fast.

00:00:12.687 --> 00:00:14.289
But now the scale is changing.

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.807
We're moving from a few projects to dozens.

00:00:16.957 --> 00:00:19.314
I want to make sure we don't outgrow our capacity.

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.968
That's what success does, it attracts more ambition.

00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:24.788
The same moves won't necessarily bring the same results.

00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:27.934
Think of what could stretch, or break, as you grow.

00:00:28.232 --> 00:00:28.662
Hmm...

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:33.862
I guess data volume will explode, and integration
between tools and teams will get trickier.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.025
Exactly.

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:41.003
Build a stronger AI hub, formalise a preferred supplier
network, and keep developing your AI academy.

00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:46.447
Remember — success at scale comes from people who
understand both AI and the business.

00:00:46.732 --> 00:00:47.568
Thanks, Carlos.

00:00:47.718 --> 00:00:49.576
As always — clear and actionable.

00:00:49.726 --> 00:00:50.655
I'll take this forward.

00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:51.767
Good luck, Sophie.

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:54.564
You've built momentum — now make it sustainable.
