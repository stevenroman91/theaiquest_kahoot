Sophie, Good to hear from you.

00:00:02.176 --> 00:00:04.416
I've been hearing great things about your work.

00:00:04.646 --> 00:00:07.724
Sounds like PlayForward is becoming quite the AI
powerhouse.

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:09.093
Impressive work so far.

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:10.282
Thanks, Carlos.

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:11.930
Things have moved fast.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.914
But now the scale is changing.

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:16.548
We're moving from a few projects to dozens.

00:00:16.698 --> 00:00:19.647
I want to make sure we don't outgrow our capacity.

00:00:19.932 --> 00:00:22.522
That's what success does, it attracts more ambition.

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:25.319
The same moves won't necessarily bring the same results.

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:28.394
Think of what could stretch, or break, as you grow.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:29.268
Hmm...

00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:34.097
I guess data volume will explode, and integration
between tools and teams will get trickier.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:35.398
That's a good start.

00:00:35.548 --> 00:00:39.333
And as the network widens, what else tends to become
more complex?

00:00:39.632 --> 00:00:40.039
People.

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.851
Skills.

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:41.895
Coordination.

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:46.433
We'll need new capabilities, and probably more structure
around partnerships.

00:00:46.732 --> 00:00:47.766
Now you're seeing it.

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:54.650
Scaling isn't just about multiplying AI use case
as it is about readiness of tech, governance and people.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.158
You already have the mindset.

00:00:56.308 --> 00:00:58.154
Just make sure the whole system can follow.

00:00:58.465 --> 00:00:59.348
Thanks, Carlos.

00:00:59.498 --> 00:01:01.797
As always — clear and actionable.

00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:02.817
I'll take this forward.

00:01:03.132 --> 00:01:03.899
Good luck, Sophie.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.649
You've built momentum — now make it sustainable.
