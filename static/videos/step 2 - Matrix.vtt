00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.730
Thanks for joining, Marcus and Elena.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.180
We've wrapped up our AI potential assessment and
mapped 9 ideas into a simple matrix — Impact vs.

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:10.500
Feasibility.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.994
Our North Star remains the same: increase player
satisfaction and reduce time-to-market by 25%.

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:20.515
Today we need to agree which initiatives to launch
first.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.307
Good.

00:00:21.357 --> 00:00:23.168
I need clarity on the trade‐offs.

00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:24.750
What does the matrix tell us?

00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:26.269
Well, on the matrix:

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:33.119
Impact captures expected value and Feasibility reflects
delivery effort—data readiness, change management,

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:34.330
and risk controls.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.931
Plotting our options on this grid surfaced a shortlist
of five that clearly stand out.

00:00:39.183 --> 00:00:39.972
Exactly.

00:00:40.022 --> 00:00:41.171
And here's the constraint:

00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:45.714
with current bandwidth, we can only take on three
out of those five in this cycle.

00:00:45.764 --> 00:00:51.684
The matrix may help us choose the three that maximize
value while keeping complexity manageable for a 90‐day

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.032
pilot‐to‐scale path.

00:00:53.283 --> 00:00:56.022
So the decision is not "what's nice to have,"

00:00:56.072 --> 00:00:57.698
it's "what moves the needle now."

00:00:57.748 --> 00:01:01.695
How do we avoid over‐indexing on quick wins and missing
foundational impact?

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.029
We'll prefer high‐value items with moderate complexity
for immediate gains but we also want to unlock compounding

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:11.052
value without pushing us beyond acceptable delivery
risk.

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:12.012
Alright

00:01:12.062 --> 00:01:16.242
Work together, I want to have the recommended three
contributing to our North Star.

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:19.078
If the rationale holds and the risks are governed,
we go.

00:01:19.476 --> 00:01:19.919
OK.

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.998
I'm launching a quick Teams poll: select the three
we commit to this cycle.

00:01:24.048 --> 00:01:28.715
We'll lock scope today, finalize owners, and start
the 90‐day pilot track immediately.
