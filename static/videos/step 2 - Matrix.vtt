00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.835
Thanks for joining, Marcus and Elena.

00:00:02.885 --> 00:00:09.445
We've wrapped up our AI potential assessment and
mapped 9 ideas into a simple matrix — Impact vs.

00:00:09.873 --> 00:00:10.639
Feasibility.

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:16.796
Our North Star remains the same: increase player
satisfaction and reduce time-to-market by 25%.

00:00:16.846 --> 00:00:19.865
Today we need to agree which initiatives to launch
first.

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:20.626
Good.

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:22.395
I need clarity on the trade‐offs.

00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:24.070
What does the matrix tell us?

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:25.685
Well, on the matrix:

00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:32.775
Impact captures expected value and Feasability reflects
delivery effort—data readiness, change management,

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:33.828
and risk controls.

00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:38.464
Plotting our options on this grid surfaced a shortlist
of five that clearly stand out.

00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:39.331
Exactly.

00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:40.484
And here's the constraint:

00:00:40.534 --> 00:00:44.725
with current bandwidth, we can only take on three
out of those five in this cycle.

00:00:44.775 --> 00:00:51.335
The matrix may helps us choose the three that maximize
value while keeping complexity manageable for a 90‐day

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:52.530
pilot‐to‐scale path.

00:00:52.783 --> 00:00:55.012
So the decision is not "what's nice to have,"

00:00:55.062 --> 00:00:56.919
it's "what moves the needle now."

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.009
How do we avoid over‐indexing on quick wins and missing
foundational impact?

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.249
We'll prefer high‐value items with moderate complexity
for immediate gains but we also want to unlock compounding

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:10.468
value without pushing us beyond acceptable delivery
risk.

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:11.552
Alright

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:15.967
Work together, I want to have the recommended three
contributing to our North Star.

00:01:16.017 --> 00:01:18.896
If the rationale holds and the risks are governed,
we go.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.707
OK.

00:01:19.757 --> 00:01:24.238
I'm launching a quick Teams poll: select the three
we commit to this cycle.

00:01:24.288 --> 00:01:29.478
We'll lock scope today, finalize owners, and start
the 90‐day pilot track immediately.
