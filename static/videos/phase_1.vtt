00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.046
Thanks everyone for joining.

00:00:02.196 --> 00:00:05.900
Thank you very much for taking the time out of your
busy schedule to meet today.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.279
I spoke to Marcus our CEO yesterday.

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.589
Together, we need to define how AI can help us move
faster, innovate smarter, and keep our creative identity

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:15.232
intact.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:19.457
I would love to hear your perspectives on how to
get started and accelerate fast.

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.098
Thanks for consulting us Sophie.

00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:22.072
I'll go first.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:24.742
From a market standpoint, speed is everything.

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:29.106
Players' expectations change weekly, if we hesitate,
we lose them!

00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:36.456
We should empower our teams to experiment with AI
tools right now: content generation, campaign optimization,

00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:37.743
player segmentation.

00:00:37.893 --> 00:00:40.656
Let them test, iterate, and learn fast.

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:47.046
With my team I have a list of 35 opportunities I
gathered in various conferences and put into an excel

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:47.633
spreadsheet.

00:00:47.783 --> 00:00:51.231
I can recommend 6 use cases we could experiment immediately.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.737
I understand your point, Amira.

00:00:52.787 --> 00:00:55.643
But transformation without structure leads to chaos.

00:00:55.693 --> 00:01:00.581
If we deploy AI too fast, we'll create silos, duplicated
tools, and confusion.

00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:06.871
We need to start by mapping where AI adds the most
value — identify the high-impact use cases and build

00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:07.493
around them.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.476
I agree speed matters, but without solid data foundations,
this won't scale.

00:01:12.526 --> 00:01:16.473
We'll soon face a surge in business data and analytics
needs.

00:01:16.523 --> 00:01:20.703
My recommendation: select a robust AI Tech platform
now.

00:01:20.853 --> 00:01:26.797
ScaleAI Pro is the leading AI platform and offers
great terms if we sign an exclusive deal.

00:01:26.947 --> 00:01:29.130
Without this, we risk chaos later.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.294
Once done, we need to extract the maximum volume
of data from our core systems and load this into the

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:38.103
AI platform before we can build anything.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.836
Thank you all for your perspective.

00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:42.332
If I summarize, we have three approaches:

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:47.226
- Amira, you propose to move fast and experiment with
6 use cases.

00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:51.864
- Elena, you suggest that we start with an AI strategy
and map the use cases.

00:01:52.114 --> 00:01:56.816
- And James, you recommend that we first Build solid
data and tech foundations.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:00.816
Each path has its merits — but we'll have to choose
one as our North Star.

00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:06.725
Our goal is clear: make AI real, measurable, and
aligned with who we are as a company.

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:11.391
I will think that this through and get back to you
with my proposed kick-off strategy.
