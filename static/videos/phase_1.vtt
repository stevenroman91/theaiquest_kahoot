Thanks everyone for joining. You've all seen Marcus' vision — we need to define how AI can help us move faster, innovate smarter, and keep our creative identity intact. Let's hear your perspectives.

I'll go first. From a market standpoint, speed is everything. Players' expectations change weekly — if we hesitate, we lose them. We should empower our teams to experiment with AI tools right now: content generation, campaign optimization, player segmentation. Let them test, iterate, and learn fast.

I understand your point, Amira. But transformation without structure leads to chaos. If we deploy AI too fast, we'll create silos, duplicated tools, and confusion. We need to start by mapping where AI adds the most value — identify the high-impact use cases and build around them.

I agree speed matters, but without solid data foundations, this won't scale. We'll soon face a surge in talent data and analytics needs. My recommendation: select a robust AI platform now. GameAI Pro is the market leader and offers great terms if we sign an exclusive deal. Without this, we risk chaos later.

So we have three approaches: Move fast and experiment, Build on solid foundations or Start with a value map. Each path has its merits — but we'll have to choose one as our North Star. Our goal is clear: make AI real, measurable, and aligned with who we are as a company. Let's make the right call. Every decision from here will shape our AI future.
