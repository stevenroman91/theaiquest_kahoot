00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.058
Thanks everyone for joining.

00:00:02.208 --> 00:00:05.911
Thank you very much for taking the time out of your
busy schedule to meet today.

00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:08.116
I spoke to Marcus our CEO yesterday.

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:14.506
Together, we need to define how AI can help us move
faster, innovate smarter, and keep our creative identity

00:00:14.506 --> 00:00:15.151
intact.

00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:19.620
I would love to hear your perspectives on how to
get started and accelerate fast.

00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.207
Thanks for consulting us Sophie.

00:00:21.357 --> 00:00:22.112
I'll go first.

00:00:22.262 --> 00:00:24.781
From a market standpoint, speed is everything.

00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:28.971
Players' expectations change weekly, if we hesitate,
we lose them!

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:36.001
We should empower our teams to experiment with AI
tools right now: content generation, campaign optimization,

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.121
player segmentation.

00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:40.301
Let them test, iterate, and learn fast.

00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:46.211
With my team I have a list of 35 opportunities I
gathered in various conferences and put into an excel

00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:46.755
spreadsheet.

00:00:46.905 --> 00:00:50.179
I can recommend 6 use cases we could experiment immediately.

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.740
I understand your point, Amira.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.843
But transformation without structure leads to chaos.

00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:59.688
If we deploy AI too fast, we'll create silos, duplicated
tools, and confusion.

00:00:59.738 --> 00:01:06.778
We need to start by mapping where AI adds the most
value — identify the high-impact use cases, formalize

00:01:06.778 --> 00:01:10.222
an AI strategy driven by business priorities and build
around it.

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:15.116
I agree speed matters, but without solid data foundations,
this won't scale.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:18.927
We'll soon face a surge in business data and analytics
needs.

00:01:18.977 --> 00:01:23.203
My recommendation: select a robust AI Tech platform
now.

00:01:23.353 --> 00:01:29.251
ScaleAI Pro is the leading AI platform and offers
great terms if we sign an exclusive deal.

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:31.677
Without this, we risk chaos later.

00:01:31.827 --> 00:01:37.736
Once done, we need to extract the maximum volume
of data from our core systems and load this into the

00:01:37.736 --> 00:01:40.604
AI platform before we can build anything.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.174
Thank you all for your perspective.

00:01:42.324 --> 00:01:44.321
If I summarize, we have three approaches:

00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:49.006
- Amira, you propose to move fast and experiment with
6 use cases.

00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:53.842
- Elena, you suggest that we start with an AI strategy
and map the use cases.

00:01:54.092 --> 00:01:58.875
- And James, you recommend that we first Build solid
data and tech foundations.

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:03.409
Each path has its merits — but we'll have to choose
one as our North Star.

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:09.562
Our goal is clear: make AI real, measurable, and
aligned with who we are as a company.

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:14.112
I will think that this through and get back to you
with my proposed kick-off strategy.
