Hi Elena!

00:00:01.937 --> 00:00:05.702
It's been a whirlwind these past weeks — but the
pilots are finally live.

00:00:05.852 --> 00:00:10.229
The design team is using the Smart Assistant daily,
and the first results look promising.

00:00:10.483 --> 00:00:11.551
That's great news.

00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:14.673
But I guess you're already thinking about what comes
next!

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:15.682
Exactly.

00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:21.672
Marcus wants early impact, but I'm worried that without
the right support, these pilots might not scale.

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:27.232
I've been reviewing potential enablers — initiatives
that can make adoption faster and safer.

00:00:27.483 --> 00:00:28.504
Enablers?

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:29.397
You mean...

00:00:29.547 --> 00:00:30.894
like support actions?

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.916
Exactly.

00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:36.036
Think of them as building blocks that make pilots
easier and safer.

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:42.374
And we can't just pick randomly—we need balance across
three areas: Technology, Governance and People.

00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:44.427
Okay, so not just tech stuff.

00:00:44.683 --> 00:00:45.275
Right.

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:49.546
It's about the whole picture—experience, tools, and
how we run things.

00:00:49.696 --> 00:00:50.880
And timing matters!

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.875
Some enablers we need right now, others can wait.

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:56.579
Plus, budget's tight—we can't do everything at once.

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:57.605
Got it.

00:00:57.755 --> 00:00:58.777
So what's next?

00:00:59.016 --> 00:01:02.626
Having a balance between these 3 domains is very
important.

00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:04.680
We must not neglect any of them.

00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:05.798
I see.

00:01:05.948 --> 00:01:08.316
Is there anything else we should be careful about?

00:01:08.583 --> 00:01:12.472
I'll shortlist a few enablers — one from each area —
and share them with you.

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:15.815
If we agree, we kick off the pilots and track impact.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.932
Sounds good.

00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:18.150
Send me the list.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.089
I'm in.
