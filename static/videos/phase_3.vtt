Hi Elena! It's been a whirlwind these past weeks — but the pilots are finally live. The design team is using the Smart Assistant daily, and the first results look promising.

That's great news. But I guess you're already thinking about what comes next!

Exactly. Marcus wants early impact, but I'm worried that without the right support, these pilots might not scale. I've been reviewing potential enablers — initiatives that can make adoption faster and safer.

Enablers? You mean... like support actions?

13
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:50.578
Yes! Think of them as building blocks that make pilots easier and safer. And we can't just pick randomly—we need balance across three areas: Transformation & Change, Technology & Partnerships, Policies & Governance.

Okay, so not just tech stuff.

00:01:00.578 --> 00:01:10.250
Right. It's about the whole picture—experience, tools, and how we run things. And timing matters! Some enablers we need right now, others can wait. Plus, budget's tight—we can't do everything at once.

Got it. So what's next?

25
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.699
Having a balance between these 3 domains is very important. We must not neglect any of them.

I see. Is there anything else we should be careful about?

00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:41.791
I'll shortlist a few enablers — one from each area — and share them with you. If we agree, we kick off the pilots and track impact.

Sounds good. Send me the list. I'm in.
