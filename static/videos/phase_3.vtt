Hi Elena!

00:00:01.986 --> 00:00:05.794
It's been a whirlwind these past weeks — but the
pilots are finally live.

00:00:05.944 --> 00:00:10.554
The design team is using the Smart Assistant daily,
and the first results look promising.

00:00:10.816 --> 00:00:11.744
That's great news.

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:14.959
But I guess you're already thinking about what comes
next!

00:00:15.216 --> 00:00:15.842
Exactly.

00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:20.869
Marcus wants early impact, but I'm worried that without
the right support, these pilots might not scale.

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:26.440
I've been reviewing potential enablers — initiatives
that can make adoption faster and safer.

00:00:26.683 --> 00:00:27.658
Enablers?

00:00:27.808 --> 00:00:28.551
You mean...

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:30.094
like support actions?

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.976
Exactly.

00:00:31.126 --> 00:00:34.633
Think of them as building blocks that make pilots
easier and safer.

00:00:34.783 --> 00:00:41.737
And we can't just pick randomly—we need balance across
three pillars: Technology, Governance and People.

00:00:41.983 --> 00:00:43.933
Okay, so not just tech stuff.

00:00:44.183 --> 00:00:44.821
Right.

00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:48.884
It's about the whole picture—experience, tools, and
how we run things.

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:50.322
And timing matters!

00:00:50.472 --> 00:00:53.154
Some enablers we need right now, others can wait.

00:00:53.304 --> 00:00:56.915
Plus, budget's tight—we can't do everything at once.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.985
Got it.

00:00:58.135 --> 00:00:59.157
So what's next?

00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:02.585
Having a balance between these 3 pillars is very
important.

00:01:02.735 --> 00:01:04.395
We must not neglect any of them.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.532
I see.

00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:08.050
Is there anything else we should be careful about?

00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:11.903
I'll shortlist a few enablers — one from each pillar —
and share them with you.

00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:15.524
If we agree, we kick off the pilots and track impact.

00:01:15.783 --> 00:01:16.526
Sounds good.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:17.651
Send me the list.

00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:18.683
I'm in.
