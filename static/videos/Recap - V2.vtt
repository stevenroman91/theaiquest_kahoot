Look how far we've come, Sophie.

00:00:02.675 --> 00:00:06.854
When we started this journey, AI was just an idea —
a possibility.

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:08.955
Now, it's part of everything we do.

00:00:09.265 --> 00:00:10.961
It feels incredible, Marcus.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:13.444
A year ago, we were running experiments.

00:00:13.594 --> 00:00:19.875
Today, our teams use AI every day — in design, analytics,
marketing, even storytelling.

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:23.520
It's changed how we create, collaborate, and make
decisions.

00:00:23.832 --> 00:00:24.715
And it shows!

00:00:24.865 --> 00:00:30.856
I can't remember our last strategy meeting that didn't
involve data-driven insights or AI-powered forecasts.

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:34.674
But what really makes me proud isn't the technology —
it's the people.

00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:38.168
They've grown, adapted, and made Artificial Intelligence
their own.

00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:39.162
Exactly.

00:00:39.312 --> 00:00:41.971
The transformation worked because it stayed human.

00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:44.466
We didn't just automate; we empowered.

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:48.169
We gave everyone the chance to experiment, learn,
and contribute.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.995
That's the secret — AI didn't replace our creativity,
it amplified it.

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:57.428
And thanks to your leadership, PlayNext has become
a reference in the gaming world for responsible, innovative

00:00:57.428 --> 00:00:58.414
use of AI.

00:00:58.699 --> 00:00:59.663
Thank you, Marcus.

00:00:59.813 --> 00:01:01.079
But it's only the beginning.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.433
We've built the foundations — now it's time to keep
evolving.

00:01:04.732 --> 00:01:05.801
I couldn't agree more.

00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:07.251
How about a new challenge?

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.444
We just opened a new studio in Milano.

00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:14.865
I'd like you to lead our AI and data integration
there — replicate what we've achieved here, but adapt

00:01:14.865 --> 00:01:16.421
it to a whole new market.

00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:17.871
Do you think you're ready?

00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:19.210
Absolutely!

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.898
Let's bring the PlayNext spirit — and our vision
of human-centered AI — to the next level.
