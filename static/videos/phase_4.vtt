Hey James — got a minute?

00:00:01.978 --> 00:00:03.337
I was actually looking for you.

00:00:03.632 --> 00:00:04.747
Sure, what's up?

00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:07.296
The pilots went better than we expected.

00:00:07.446 --> 00:00:13.526
The design team's assistant is saving them hours
each week, and the player-journey model is already

00:00:13.526 --> 00:00:14.749
improving retention.

00:00:15.032 --> 00:00:16.193
Congratulations!

00:00:16.343 --> 00:00:17.922
Now the real work begins.

00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:20.183
That's exactly why I came to see you.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:25.773
The time has finally come to scale these solutions
and implement real changes in how we operate systems,

00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:26.927
roles, and workflows.

00:00:27.077 --> 00:00:30.920
I've identified a few enablers that could help, but
I'm not sure where to start.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.941
What about you?

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:35.855
We need to better integrate AI with our existing
platforms.

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:42.007
There's also a lot to do on the business side — we
need to make sure AI reaches more players, markets,

00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:43.157
and functions.

00:00:43.307 --> 00:00:49.297
Finally, we should strengthen our data pipelines
and monitoring systems to track model performance.

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:50.052
Got it!

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:54.881
We're also looking at enablers to make this scale-up
stick, but I'm not sure where to begin.

00:00:55.165 --> 00:01:01.632
Start with the foundations to make AI work: APIs
and data pipelines connecting our internal systems,

00:01:01.632 --> 00:01:06.683
proper access controls, and a production-ready environment
to manage models and prompts.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:13.439
In parallel, prepare the rollout — a simple adoption
plan, and transparent performance metrics: delivery

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.282
speed, player satisfaction, and adoption by the teams.

00:01:17.565 --> 00:01:19.725
Alright, there is a lot on our plate.

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:23.811
Timing matters and budget is tight, so we can't do
everything at once.

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:25.864
Welcome to my world Sophie !

00:01:26.014 --> 00:01:29.915
You'll have to phase it and decide which initiatives
matter most now.

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.943
Perfect.

00:01:31.093 --> 00:01:35.725
Let me think about the top priority enablers and
loop you in for the integration stream.

00:01:36.032 --> 00:01:37.008
Count me in.
