Hey James — got a minute? I was actually looking for you.

Sure, what's up?

The pilots went better than we expected. The design team's assistant is saving them hours each week, and the player-journey model is already improving retention.

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:42.051
That's exactly why I came to see you. The time has finally come to scale these solutions and implement real changes in how we operate systems, roles, and workflows. I've identified a few enablers that could help, but I'm not sure where to start. What about you?

We need to better integrate AI with our existing platforms. There's also a lot to do on the business side — we need to make sure AI reaches more players, markets, and functions. Finally, we should strengthen our data pipelines and monitoring systems to track model performance.

19
00:01:02.803 --> 00:01:07.406
Got it! We're also looking at enablers to make this scale-up stick, but I'm not sure where to begin.

00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:28.808
Start with the foundations: APIs and data pipelines connecting our internal systems, proper access controls, and a production-ready environment to manage models and prompts. In parallel, prepare the rollout — clear use cases for each business area, a simple adoption plan, and transparent performance metrics: delivery speed, player satisfaction, and adoption by creative teams.

25
00:01:32.808 --> 00:01:35.109
Budget's tight, so we can't do everything at once.

Welcome to my world Sophie ! You'll have to phase it.

Perfect. I'll draft the scale plan with owners and timelines and loop you in for the integration stream.
