Hey James — got a minute?

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.580
I was actually looking for you.

00:00:03.865 --> 00:00:05.026
Sure, what's up?

00:00:05.332 --> 00:00:07.608
The pilots went better than we expected.

00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:13.038
The design team's assistant is saving them hours
each week, and the player-journey model is already

00:00:13.038 --> 00:00:14.178
improving retention.

00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:15.766
Congratulations!

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.541
Now the real work begins.

00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:19.562
That's exactly why I came to see you.

00:00:19.712 --> 00:00:24.992
The time has finally come to scale these solutions
and implement real changes in how we operate systems,

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:26.179
roles, and workflows.

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.754
I've identified a few enablers that could help, but
I'm not sure where to start.

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:30.705
What about you?

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.808
We need to better integrate AI with our existing
platforms.

00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:41.030
There's also a lot to do on the business side — we
need to make sure AI reaches more players, markets,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.202
and functions.

00:00:42.352 --> 00:00:48.389
Finally, we should strengthen our data pipelines
and monitoring systems to track model performance.

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:49.164
Got it!

00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:53.795
We're also looking at enablers to make this scale-up
stick, but I'm not sure where to begin.

00:00:54.099 --> 00:01:00.497
Start with the foundations to make AI work: APIs
and data pipelines connecting our internal systems,

00:01:00.497 --> 00:01:05.663
proper access controls, and a production-ready environment
to manage models and prompts.

00:01:05.813 --> 00:01:12.152
In parallel, prepare the rollout — a simple adoption
plan, and transparent performance metrics: delivery

00:01:12.152 --> 00:01:15.612
speed, player satisfaction, and adoption by the teams.

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.071
Alright, there is a lot on our plate.

00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:22.063
Timing matters and budget is tight, so we can't do
everything at once.

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:24.037
Welcome to my world Sophie !

00:01:24.187 --> 00:01:27.995
You'll have to phase it and decide which initiatives
matter most now.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:28.880
Perfect.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.813
Let me think about the top priority enablers and
loop you in for the integration stream.

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:35.028
Count me in.
