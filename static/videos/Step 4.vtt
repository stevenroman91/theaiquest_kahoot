Hey James — got a minute?

00:00:02.176 --> 00:00:03.499
I was actually looking for you.

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:04.960
Sure, what's up?

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:07.332
The pilots went better than we expected.

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:12.442
The design team's assistant is saving them hours
each week, and the player-journey model is already

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:13.554
improving retention.

00:00:13.865 --> 00:00:15.026
Congratulations!

00:00:15.176 --> 00:00:16.802
Now the real work begins.

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.120
That's exactly why I came to see you.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.790
The time has finally come to scale these solutions
and implement real changes in how we operate systems,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.980
roles, and workflows.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.427
I've identified a few enablers that could help, but
I'm not sure where to start.

00:00:29.577 --> 00:00:30.286
What about you?

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.129
We need to better integrate AI with our existing
platforms.

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:40.142
There's also a lot to do on the business side — we
need to make sure AI reaches more players, markets,

00:00:40.142 --> 00:00:41.384
and functions.

00:00:41.534 --> 00:00:47.432
Finally, we should strengthen our data pipelines
and monitoring systems to track model performance.

00:00:47.732 --> 00:00:48.359
Got it!

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:52.840
We're also looking at enablers to make this scale-up
stick, but I'm not sure where to begin.

00:00:53.132 --> 00:01:00.284
Start with the foundations: APIs and data pipelines
connecting our internal systems, proper access controls,

00:01:00.284 --> 00:01:03.999
and a production-ready environment to manage models
and prompts.

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:10.430
In parallel, prepare the rollout — clear use cases
for each business area, a simple adoption plan, and

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.920
transparent performance metrics: delivery speed, player
satisfaction, and adoption by creative teams.

00:01:17.232 --> 00:01:20.030
Budget's tight, so we can't do everything at once.

00:01:20.332 --> 00:01:21.958
Welcome to my world Sophie !

00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:23.315
You'll have to phase it.

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:24.215
Perfect.

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:29.473
I'll draft the scale plan with owners and timelines
and loop you in for the integration stream.

00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:30.741
Count me in.
