00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.837
Thanks everyone for joining.

00:00:01.887 --> 00:00:08.527
You've all seen Marcus' vision — we need to define
how AI can help us move faster, innovate smarter,

00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:10.780
and keep our creative identity intact.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.398
Let's hear your perspectives.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.335
I'll go first.

00:00:13.385 --> 00:00:15.963
From a market standpoint, speed is everything.

00:00:16.013 --> 00:00:20.367
Players' expectations change weekly — if we hesitate,
we lose them.

00:00:20.517 --> 00:00:27.077
We should empower our teams to experiment with AI
tools right now: content generation, campaign optimization,

00:00:27.077 --> 00:00:28.237
player segmentation.

00:00:28.287 --> 00:00:30.911
Let them test, iterate, and learn fast.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.555
I understand your point, Amira.

00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:35.786
But transformation without structure leads to chaos.

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:40.956
If we deploy AI too fast, we'll create silos, duplicated
tools, and confusion.

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:46.846
We need to start by mapping where AI adds the most
value — identify the high-impact use cases and build

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:47.380
around them.

00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:52.342
I agree speed matters, but without solid data foundations,
this won't scale.

00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:56.200
We'll soon face a surge in talent data and analytics
needs.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.104
My recommendation: select a robust AI platform now.

00:01:00.254 --> 00:01:05.641
GameAI Pro is the market leader and offers great
terms if we sign an exclusive deal.

00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:07.874
Without this, we risk chaos later.

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.602
So we have three approaches:

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:13.681
Move fast and experiment, Build on solid foundations
or Start with a value map.

00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:18.064
Each path has its merits — but we'll have to choose
one as our North Star.

00:01:18.114 --> 00:01:24.453
Our goal is clear: make AI real, measurable, and
aligned with who we are as a company.

00:01:24.503 --> 00:01:25.223
Let's make the right call

00:01:25.412 --> 00:01:28.628
Every decision from here will shape our AI future.
