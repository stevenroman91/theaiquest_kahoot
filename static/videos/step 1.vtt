00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.988
Thanks everyone for joining.

00:00:02.138 --> 00:00:05.668
Thank you very much for taking the time out of your
busy schedule to meet today.

00:00:05.818 --> 00:00:07.989
I spoke to Marcus our CEO yesterday.

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:14.779
Together, we need to define how AI can help us move
faster, innovate smarter, and keep our creative identity

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:15.407
intact.

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:19.887
I would love to hear your perspectives on how to
get started and accelerate fast.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.555
Thanks for consulting us Sophie.

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:22.530
I'll go first.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.350
From a market standpoint, speed is everything.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.749
Players' expectations change weekly, if we hesitate,
we lose them!

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:36.299
We should empower our teams to experiment with AI
tools right now: content generation, campaign optimization,

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:37.364
player segmentation.

00:00:37.514 --> 00:00:40.510
Let them test, iterate, and learn fast.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.220
With my team I have a list of 35 opportunities I
gathered in various conferences and put into an excel

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.881
spreadsheet.

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:51.584
I can recommend 6 use cases we could experiment immediately.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.011
I understand your point, Amira.

00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:56.045
But transformation without structure leads to chaos.

00:00:56.095 --> 00:01:01.180
If we deploy AI too fast, we'll create silos, duplicated
tools, and confusion.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.030
We need to start by mapping where AI adds the most
value — identify the high-impact use cases and build

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.545
around them.

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:13.509
I agree speed matters, but without solid data foundations,
this won't scale.

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:17.274
We'll soon face a surge in business data and analytics
needs.

00:01:17.324 --> 00:01:21.318
My recommendation: select a robust AI Tech platform
now.

00:01:21.468 --> 00:01:27.412
ScaleAI Pro is the leading AI platform and offers
great terms if we sign an exclusive deal.

00:01:27.562 --> 00:01:29.977
Without this, we risk chaos later.

00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:36.002
Once done, we need to extract the maximum volume
of data from our core systems and load this into the

00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:38.997
AI platform before we can build anything.

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:40.632
Thank you all for your perspective.

00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:42.872
If I summarize, we have three approaches:

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:46.814
- Amira, you propose to move fast and experiment with
6 use cases.

00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:52.184
- Elena, you suggest that we start with an AI strategy
and map the use cases.

00:01:52.434 --> 00:01:56.718
- And James, you recommend that we first Build solid
data and tech foundations.

00:01:56.968 --> 00:02:00.927
Each path has its merits — but we'll have to choose
one as our North Star.

00:02:01.077 --> 00:02:06.626
Our goal is clear: make AI real, measurable, and
aligned with who we are as a company.

00:02:06.776 --> 00:02:10.677
I will think that this through and get back to you
with my proposed kick-off strategy.
