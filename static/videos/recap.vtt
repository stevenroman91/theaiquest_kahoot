Look how far we've come, Sophie. When we started this journey, AI was just an idea — a possibility. Now, it's part of everything we do.

00:00:09.328 --> 00:00:14.704
It feels incredible, Marcus. A year ago, we were running experiments. Today, our teams use AI every day — in design, analytics, marketing, even storytelling. It's changed how we create, collaborate, and make decisions.

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:27.139
And it shows! I can't remember our last strategy meeting that didn't involve data-driven insights or AI-powered forecasts. But what really makes me proud isn't the technology — it's the people. They've grown, adapted, and made Artificial Intelligence their own.

13
00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:37.183
Exactly. The transformation worked because it stayed human. We didn't just automate; we empowered. We gave everyone the chance to experiment, learn, and contribute.

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:08.621
I couldn't agree more. How about a new challenge? We just opened a new studio in Milano. I'd like you to lead our AI and data integration there — replicate what we've achieved here, but adapt it to a whole new market. Do you think you're ready?
