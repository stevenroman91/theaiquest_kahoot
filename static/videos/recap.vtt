Look how far we've come, Sophie.

00:00:02.675 --> 00:00:06.437
When we started this journey, AI was just an idea —
a possibility.

00:00:06.587 --> 00:00:08.537
Now, it's part of everything we do.

00:00:08.787 --> 00:00:10.389
It feels incredible, Marcus.

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.198
Not so long ago we were running experiments.

00:00:13.348 --> 00:00:20.221
Today, our teams use Artificial Intelligence every
day — in game design, marketing, HR, even storytelling.

00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:24.086
It's changed how we create, collaborate, and make
decisions.

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:25.311
And it shows.

00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:31.127
I can't remember our last strategy meeting that didn't
involve data-driven insights or AI-powered forecasts.

00:00:31.277 --> 00:00:34.806
But what really makes me proud isn't the technology —
it's the people.

00:00:34.956 --> 00:00:37.604
They've grown, adapted, and made AI their own.

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:38.666
Exactly.

00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:41.196
The transformation worked because it stayed human.

00:00:41.346 --> 00:00:44.202
We didn't just automate; we empowered.

00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:47.615
We gave everyone the chance to experiment, learn,
and contribute.

00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:51.719
That's the secret — AI didn't replace our creativity,
it amplified it.

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:56.699
And thanks to your leadership, PlayForward has become
a reference in the betting and gambling world for

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.160
responsible, innovative use of AI.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.444
Thank you, Marcus.

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:01.894
But it's only the beginning.

00:01:02.044 --> 00:01:06.142
We've built the foundations for PlayForward — now
it's time to keep evolving.

00:01:06.392 --> 00:01:07.553
I couldn't agree more.

00:01:07.703 --> 00:01:08.957
How about a new challenge?

00:01:09.107 --> 00:01:11.150
We just opened a new studio in Milano.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.420
I'd like you to lead our AI and data integration
there — replicate what we've achieved here but adapt

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.895
it to a whole new market.

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:19.485
Do you think you're ready?

00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:20.780
Absolutely!

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.210
Let's bring the PlayForward spirit — and our vision
of human-centered Artificial Intelligence — to the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.897
next level.
