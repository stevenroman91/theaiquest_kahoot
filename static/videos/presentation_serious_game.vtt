00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.395
Hello everyone and welcome.

00:00:02.545 --> 00:00:08.305
I am Steven, and I am thrilled to have you here for
The AI Transformation Simulation for Leaders, created

00:00:08.305 --> 00:00:11.925
exclusively by FDJ UNITED and for FDJ UNITED.

00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:16.739
This is not just another training, this is a serious
game designed for decision-makers like you.

00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:22.889
In this experience, you'll face real-world challenges,
make strategic choices, and see their impact unfold —

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.134
all in real time.

00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:27.763
I'll be guiding you throughout the game and give
you regular feedback as you progress.

00:00:28.013 --> 00:00:31.090
What if generative AI became a real lever for your
teams?

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.944
Not a trend.

00:00:32.124 --> 00:00:32.695
Not jargon.

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:37.515
But a real lever to boost creativity, speed, and
engagement across the customer experience and the

00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:38.425
employee journey!

00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:43.805
Welcome to the AI transformation Simulation for Leaders -
a hands-on experience designed for decision-makers

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:44.644
like you!

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:50.584
Here, you'll face real challenges, interact with
your peers, and see the impact of every decision unfold,

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:51.698
in real time.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.276
Your journey follows five clear, practical steps.

00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:59.184
In the first step, you'll define your AI vision and
strategy.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:00:59.961
Next,

00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:02.221
You will choose the right use cases,

00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:07.255
the ones that deliver real value, quickly, with manageable
risk and reasonable effort.

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.259
In the step three,

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:12.121
You'll launch your first pilots and demonstrate their
potential to build momentum.

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:15.263
You will then industrialize what works!

00:01:15.493 --> 00:01:19.360
Activating the right governance, people and technology
enablers at the right time.

00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.000
Finally,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.637
you'll extend AI across the entire ecosystem: from
recruitment to retention.

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:31.492
Throughout the simulation, you'll play the role of
Sophie, the AI Director of an online betting and lottery

00:01:31.492 --> 00:01:33.221
company called Play Forward.

00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:38.091
You will interact with key stakeholders, navigate
realistic scenarios, and have to strike the right

00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:40.790
balance across value, risk, and ethics.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.045
Now it's your turn.

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:43.821
Every choice matters.

00:01:44.051 --> 00:01:44.493
Shape.

00:01:44.723 --> 00:01:45.177
Choose.

00:01:45.407 --> 00:01:46.117
Secure.

00:01:46.587 --> 00:01:47.230
Scale.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.982
Across the 5 steps of the game.

00:01:49.132 --> 00:01:53.765
And unlock the full potential of your teams—in our
sector, in our reality!

00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:54.503
Good luck!
