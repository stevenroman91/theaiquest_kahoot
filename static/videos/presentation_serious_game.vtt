Hello everyone and welcome.

00:00:02.452 --> 00:00:08.292
I am Steven, and I am thrilled to have you here for
The AI Transformation Simulation for Leaders, created

00:00:08.292 --> 00:00:10.404
exclusively by FDJ UNITED.

00:00:10.504 --> 00:00:15.334
This is not just another training, this is a serious
game designed for decision-makers like you.

00:00:15.484 --> 00:00:21.404
In this experience, you'll face real-world challenges,
make strategic choices, and see their impact unfold —

00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:22.833
all in real time.

00:00:23.183 --> 00:00:26.202
What if generative AI became a real lever for your
teams?

00:00:26.302 --> 00:00:27.045
Not a trend.

00:00:27.145 --> 00:00:27.969
Not jargon.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:33.909
But a real lever to boost creativity, speed, and
engagement across the customer experience and the

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:35.302
employee journey!

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:40.522
Welcome to the AI transformation Simulation for Leaders -
a hands-on experience designed for decision-makers

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:41.080
like you!

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.180
Here, you'll face real challenges, interact with
your peers, and see the impact of every decision unfold,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.343
in real time.

00:00:48.993 --> 00:00:52.083
Your journey follows five clear, practical steps.

00:00:52.183 --> 00:00:55.852
In the first step, you'll define your AI vision and
strategy.

00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:56.569
Next,

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:58.329
You will choose the right use cases,

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.352
the ones that deliver real value, quickly, with manageable
risk and reasonable effort.

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:04.464
In the step three,

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:08.894
You'll launch your first pilots and demonstrate their
potential to build momentum.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.414
You will then Industrialize what works!

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:17.543
Activate the right skills, processes, governance,
and ensure data security and compliance.

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:18.283
Finally,

00:01:18.383 --> 00:01:23.328
you'll extend AI across the entire ecosystem: from
recruitment to retention.

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:29.833
Throughout the simulation, you'll interact with key
stakeholders, navigate realistic scenarios, and balance

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:31.873
value, risk, and ethics.

00:01:31.973 --> 00:01:33.192
The stakes are high!

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:40.012
demystify AI, lead with purpose, and turn potential
into performance without losing the human spark that

00:01:40.012 --> 00:01:41.802
defines PlayForward.

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:42.726
Now it's your turn.

00:01:42.826 --> 00:01:44.034
Every choice matters.

00:01:44.264 --> 00:01:44.880
Integrate.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.866
Secure.

00:01:46.016 --> 00:01:46.620
Scale.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.832
And unlock the full potential of your teams— in your
sector, in your reality.

00:01:51.932 --> 00:01:52.454
Good luck!
