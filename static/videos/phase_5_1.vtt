There you are, Sophie — congratulations!

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.995
The executive committee is thrilled with the results.

00:00:06.145 --> 00:00:08.967
They now want to accelerate deployment company-wide.

00:00:09.265 --> 00:00:11.738
That's great news, but it's also a big step.

00:00:11.888 --> 00:00:17.888
Scaling a few pilots was one thing; scaling dozens
of solutions across countries, functions, and partners

00:00:17.888 --> 00:00:18.947
is another story.

00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:25.553
They've identified new areas — marketing automation,
player support, predictive content creation — and

00:00:25.553 --> 00:00:26.547
want to go all-in.

00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:28.586
Ambitious and exciting!

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:32.950
But we'll need stronger data foundations, new skills,
and clear governance.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.455
Let's make sure we build for the long run, not just
the next quarter.

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:37.694
Absolutely!

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:39.145
You'll need help to get there.

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:40.955
Maybe it's time to call Carlos.

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:45.215
He is a real tech guru and just joined our Board
of Directors!

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:46.126
Good idea.

00:00:46.276 --> 00:00:48.436
He always knows how to bring perspective.
