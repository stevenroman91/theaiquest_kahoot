Hi Elena!

00:00:01.684 --> 00:00:05.643
It's been a whirlwind these past weeks — but the
pilots are finally live.

00:00:05.793 --> 00:00:10.414
The design team is using the Smart Assistant daily,
and the first results look promising.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.996
That's great news.

00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:15.072
But I guess you're already thinking about what comes
next!

00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:16.140
Exactly.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.793
Marcus wants early impact, but I'm worried that without
the right support, these pilots might not scale.

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:27.214
I've been reviewing potential enablers — initiatives
that can make adoption faster and safer.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.425
Enablers?

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:29.318
You mean...

00:00:29.468 --> 00:00:30.861
like support actions?

00:00:31.276 --> 00:00:31.766
Yes!

00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:35.097
Think of them as building blocks that make pilots
easier and safer.

00:00:35.247 --> 00:00:42.367
And we can't just pick randomly—we need balance across
three areas: Transformation & Change, Technology &

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:44.825
Partnerships, Policies & Governance.

00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:46.940
Okay, so not just tech stuff.

00:00:47.183 --> 00:00:47.740
Right.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.756
It's about the whole picture—experience, tools, and
how we run things.

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:53.171
And timing matters!

00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:55.957
Some enablers we need right now, others can wait.

00:00:56.107 --> 00:00:59.752
Plus, budget's tight—we can't do everything at once.

00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:00.759
Got it.

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:01.977
So what's next?

00:01:02.216 --> 00:01:05.211
Having a balance between these 3 domains is very
important.

00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:07.195
We must not neglect any of them.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.193
I see.

00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:10.804
Is there anything else we should be careful about?

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.498
I'll shortlist a few enablers — one from each area —
and share them with you.

00:01:14.648 --> 00:01:18.084
If we agree, we kick off the pilots and track impact.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.278
Sounds good.

00:01:19.428 --> 00:01:20.404
Send me the list.

00:01:20.554 --> 00:01:21.250
I'm in.
