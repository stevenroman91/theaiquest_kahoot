Sophie!

00:00:01.514 --> 00:00:03.023
I've been following your progress.

00:00:03.173 --> 00:00:04.415
Impressive work so far.

00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:05.721
Thanks, Carlos.

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:07.810
But now the scale is changing.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.863
We're moving from a few projects to dozens.

00:00:11.013 --> 00:00:13.451
I want to make sure we don't outgrow our capacity.

00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:14.218
You're right.

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:20.368
Scaling multiple AI solutions means managing three
things at once: data volume, ecosystem integration,

00:00:20.368 --> 00:00:21.752
and people capabilities.

00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:27.902
You'll need to expand your data management capacity,
reinforce integration with existing systems, and invest

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:30.331
in skills and partnerships to sustain growth.

00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:34.928
So it's less about multiplying models, and more about
multiplying readiness.

00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:35.836
Exactly.

00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:41.791
Build a stronger AI hub, formalise a preferred supplier
network, and keep developing your AI academy.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:47.433
Remember — success at scale comes from people who
understand both AI and the business.

00:00:47.732 --> 00:00:48.754
Thanks, Carlos.

00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:51.400
As always — clear and actionable.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.758
I'll take this forward.

00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:53.925
Good luck, Sophie.

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:57.151
You've built momentum — now make it sustainable.
