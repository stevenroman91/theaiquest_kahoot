00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.823
Thanks for joining, Marcus and Elena.

00:00:02.873 --> 00:00:08.633
We've wrapped up our AI potential assessment and
mapped 9 ideas into a simple matrix — Impact vs.

00:00:09.198 --> 00:00:09.989
Feasibility.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:16.936
Our North Star remains the same: increase player
satisfaction and reduce time-to-market by 25%.

00:00:16.986 --> 00:00:19.923
Today we need to agree which initiatives to launch
first.

00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:20.647
Good.

00:00:20.697 --> 00:00:22.508
I need clarity on the trade‐offs.

00:00:22.558 --> 00:00:24.091
What does the matrix tell us?

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.696
Well, on the matrix:

00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:32.546
Impact captures expected value and Feasibility reflects
delivery effort—data readiness, change management,

00:00:32.546 --> 00:00:33.722
and risk controls.

00:00:33.772 --> 00:00:39.032
Plotting our options on this grid surfaced a shortlist
of five that clearly stand out.

00:00:39.443 --> 00:00:40.153
Exactly.

00:00:40.203 --> 00:00:41.608
And here's the constraint:

00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:45.884
with current bandwidth, we can only take on three
out of those five in this cycle.

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:52.574
The matrix may help us choose the three that maximize
value while keeping complexity manageable for a 90‐day

00:00:52.574 --> 00:00:53.933
pilot‐to‐scale path.

00:00:54.183 --> 00:00:56.504
So the decision is not "what's nice to have,"

00:00:56.554 --> 00:00:58.226
it's "what moves the needle now."

00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:02.038
How do we avoid over‐indexing on quick wins and missing
foundational impact?

00:01:02.283 --> 00:01:08.683
We'll prefer high‐value items with moderate complexity
for immediate gains but we also want to unlock compounding

00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:11.988
value without pushing us beyond acceptable delivery
risk.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.900
Alright

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.990
Work together, I want to have the recommended three
contributing to our North Star.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.733
If the rationale holds and the risks are governed,
we go.

00:01:19.983 --> 00:01:20.412
OK.

00:01:20.462 --> 00:01:25.060
I'm launching a quick Teams poll: select the three
we commit to this cycle.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.032
We'll lock scope today, finalize owners, and start
the 90‐day pilot track immediately.
