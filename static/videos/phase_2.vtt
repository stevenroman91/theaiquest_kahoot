Thanks for joining, Marcus and Elena. We've wrapped up our AI potential assessment and mapped 9 ideas into a simple matrix — Impact vs. Feasibility. Our North Star remains the same: increase player satisfaction and reduce time-to-market by 25%. Today we need to agree which initiatives to launch first.

Good. I need clarity on the trade‐offs. What does the matrix tell us?

Well, on the matrix: Impact captures expected value and Feasability reflects delivery effort—data readiness, change management, and risk controls. Plotting our options on this grid surfaced a shortlist of five that clearly stand out.

Exactly. And here's the constraint: with current bandwidth, we can only take on three out of those five in this cycle. The matrix may helps us choose the three that maximize value while keeping complexity manageable for a 90‐day pilot‐to‐scale path.

15
00:00:47.754 --> 00:00:52.830
So the decision is not "what's nice to have," it's "what moves the needle now." How do we avoid over‐indexing on quick wins and missing foundational impact?

17
00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.394
We'll prefer high‐value items with moderate complexity for immediate gains but we also want to unlock compounding value without pushing us beyond acceptable delivery risk.

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:07.308
Alright . Work together, I want to have the recommended three contributing to our North Star. If the rationale holds and the risks are governed, we go.

21
00:01:09.308 --> 00:01:14.709
OK. I'm launching a quick Teams poll: select the three we commit to this cycle. We'll lock scope today, finalize owners, and start the 90‐day pilot track immediately.
