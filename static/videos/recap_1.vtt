Sophie...

00:00:01.746 --> 00:00:06.437
I appreciate the effort, but I have to be honest —
this isn't the success we were hoping for.

00:00:06.687 --> 00:00:07.673
I know, Marcus.

00:00:07.823 --> 00:00:12.142
Some ideas worked, but the overall impact just isn't
there yet.

00:00:12.392 --> 00:00:12.996
Exactly.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.654
We've learned, but learning alone isn't enough.

00:00:15.804 --> 00:00:17.894
I need to see value, measurable change.

00:00:18.144 --> 00:00:21.348
We'll take a step back, refocus, and build on what
we've started.

00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:22.248
Do that.

00:00:22.398 --> 00:00:25.045
The potential is here — now we need execution.
